The Model itself [here](https://huggingface.co/dimanoid12331/distilbert-NER_finetuned_on_mountines).

It is fine-tuned [DistilBERT-NER](https://huggingface.co/dslim/distilbert-NER) model with the classifier replaced to increase the number of classes from 9 to 11. Two additional classes is I-MOU and B-MOU what stands for mountains.
Inital new classifier inherited all weights and biases from original and add new neurons with weights initialized by xavier_uniform_ function.

#### How to use

This model can be utilized with the Transformers *pipeline* for NER, similar to the BERT models.

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForTokenClassification
from transformers import pipeline
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("dimanoid12331/distilbert-NER_finetuned_on_mountains")
model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained("dimanoid12331/distilbert-NER_finetuned_on_mountains")
nlp = pipeline("ner", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
example = "My name is Wolfgang and I live in Berlin"
ner_results = nlp(example)
print(ner_results)
```

Or you can just download inference_model.py, run it and follow the instructions:

Print the cuda or cpu for device

print directory for output or just press enter for current directory

print the sentence

## Training data

This model was fine-tuned on English castom arteficial dataset with sentances wich contains mountains. 

As in the dataset, each token will be classified as one of the following classes:

Abbreviation|Description
-|-
O|Outside of a named entity
B-MISC |Beginning of a miscellaneous entity right after another miscellaneous entity
I-MISC | Miscellaneous entity
B-PER |Beginning of a person’s name right after another person’s name
I-PER |Person’s name
B-ORG |Beginning of an organization right after another organization
I-ORG |organization
B-LOC |Beginning of a location right after another location
I-LOC |Location
B-MOU |Beginning of a Mountain right after another Mountain
I-MOU |Mountain
